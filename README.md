# Math_Tools
Helper functions to calculate all sorts of things

## Overview

 Something something documentation will go here at some point

   ### TODO

   - [ ] Circle functions

   - [ ] Triangle functions

   - [ ] Curves

   - [ ] Tests

Should vector 2 be vector3 with  z = 0? It would reduce the number of functions by half but would be less comprehensible. Maybe just call it vector?

# Usage
